# Zombie-Shooter-FPS-game_Unity

<p>A simple FPS game fighting against Zombies.</p><br>

<p>Download game: <a href="https://github.com/halac123b/Zombie-Shooter-FPS-game_Unity/tree/Build">Build</a></p>
<p>Some details about the game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Player has 3 types of guns with different stats about shoot delay, range and damage. Scroll mouse or press 1, 2, 3 to switch among them.</li>
  <li>Each type of gun has their own ammo, you can pick them on map.</li>
  <li>The light in game is very limited, the light on the gun will be depleted over time, you can pick the pins on map to maintain the light. Be careful with zombies in the dark.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Firt person view controller.</li>
  <li>NavMeshAgent to implement AI bot.</li>
  <li>Control multiple weapons.</li>
  <li>3D Animation and trigger animation event.</li>
  <li>Smooth movement with Linear Interpolation (Lerp) and Spherical Interpolation (Slerp).</li>
  <li>Design 3D model with ProBuilder.</li>
</ul>
